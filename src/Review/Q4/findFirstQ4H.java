//package Review.Q4;
//Question:
//Write a method findFirst that takes the root and a Predicate<TreeNode> condition.
//The method should perform a DFS (Pre-order) traversal. It should return the first node that satisfies the condition. If found, stop searching immediately and return that node. If not found, return null.
//Key Skill: Using the boolean result of condition.test(node) to decide whether to return immediately or continue recursion.
//public class findFirstQ4H {
//    public TreeNode findFirst(TreeNode root, Predicate<TreeNode> condition);
//}
