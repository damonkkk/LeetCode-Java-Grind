//Question:
//You are given the root of a binary tree. A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:
//Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
//If the current direction is right, move to the right child of the current node; otherwise, move to the left child.
//Change the direction from right to left or from left to right.
//Repeat the second and third steps until you cannot move in the tree.
//Return the length of the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.
//Challenge: You need to pass an extra state (direction) in your recursion to track if you came from the left or the right.
