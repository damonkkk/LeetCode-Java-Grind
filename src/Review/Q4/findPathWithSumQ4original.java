//Context:
//Consider a binary tree where each TreeNode contains an integer value representing its weight.
//A "path" is defined as a sequence of nodes from the root down to a leaf node.
//4.a (7 marks)
//Write a method findPathWithSum that takes the root of the tree and an integer targetSum.
//The method should find one path where the sum of all node weights in the path equals targetSum.
//Return: A List<TreeNode> containing the nodes in the path (in order from root to leaf).
//Condition: If no such path exists, return null (or an empty list).
