//Question:
//Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals targetSum.
//        Note: The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
//Challenge: You need to check every node as a potential starting point for a path.

//    public int pathSumFromAnyNode(TreeNode root, int targetSum);
