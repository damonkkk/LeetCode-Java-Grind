//package Review.Q4;
//Question:
//Write a method countNodes that takes the root of a binary tree and a Predicate<Integer> condition.
//The method should traverse the entire tree and return the count of nodes whose values satisfy the given condition.
//Example: If the predicate is x -> x % 2 == 0, count all even nodes.
//Key Skill: Calling condition.test(node.val).
//public class countNodesQ4E {
//    public int countNodes(TreeNode root, Predicate<Integer> condition);
//}
